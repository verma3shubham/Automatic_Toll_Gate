#AUTOMATIC_TOLL_GATE


An automatic toll gate is an innovative solution that is widely used to reduce traffic congestion and increase the efficiency of toll collection. The system allows vehicles to pass through the gate without any manual intervention, and the toll fee is automatically deducted from the vehicle owner's account. Arduino, a popular open-source electronics platform, can be used to design and implement an automatic toll gate system.

Description:
